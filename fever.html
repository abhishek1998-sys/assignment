She then manipulates him into thinking that someone is trying to trap him and that she will help him in every way possible. Finally, Pooja's motive is revealed when she helps Armin dump the dead body of Grace and flee from the scene. Pooja admits that it was the fever of her inner rage that gave her the courage to love someone despite not being loved back.</p>
